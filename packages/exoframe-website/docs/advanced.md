## Routing requests to specific path

Since Traefik supports routing requests to specific path, you can also do that with Exoframe.  
By default, Exoframe generates the following frontend string:

```js
// where config is project config json
Labels[`traefik.http.routers.${name}.rule`] = config.domain.includes('Host(')
  ? // if string already contains Host() - use it as is
    config.domain
  : // otherwise - wrap it into Host()
    `Host(\`${config.domain}\`)`;
```

You can route requests to path instead by using Traefik [router rules](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/#rule) and using them inside of `domain` field in config.
For example, you can route requests from `http://bots.domain.com/myhook` to your service.  
To achieve this, you will need to simply set `domain` field in the config file to ``Host(`bots.domain.com`) && Path(`/myhook`)``.
This will route all requests from `bots.domain.com/myhook` to `your.service.host/myhook`.

If you need to strip or replace path, you have to provide additional label for Traefik.
E.g. the following config will route `domain.com/myprefix` to `your.service.host`:

```json
{
  "domain": "Host(`domain.com`) && Path(`/myprefix`)",
  "labels": {
    "traefik.http.middlewares.test-stripprefix.stripprefix.prefixes": "/myprefix"
  }
}
```

For more info and options see the aforementioned Traefik [router rules](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/#rule) as well as [middlewares](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/) docs.

## Docker-compose based deployment

Deploying using docker compose works almost the same as using a normal docker compose file, but there are a few labels you should use to ensure Traefik can correctly access your application.

    version: '2'
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        labels:
          traefik.http.routers.web.rule: 'Host(`test.dev`)'
      redis:
        image: "redis:alpine"

Any of the [configuration options](https://docs.traefik.io/reference/dynamic-configuration/docker/) for the default Traefik docker setup can be used.

If you have a docker-compose.yml file, **any domain set in exoframe.json will be ignored**.

For the most part, Exoframe doesn't pass anything from `exoframe.json` to the compose.
However, one thing that is being passed is environmental variables.
You can use any variables defined in `exoframe.json` in your compose file.
First, define them in your `exoframe.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "test-compose-deploy",
  "env": {
    "CUSTOM_LABEL": "custom-value",
    "CUSTOM_SECRET": "@test-secret"
  }
}
```

Then use them inside your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    labels:
      traefik.http.routers.web.rule: 'Host(`test.dev`)'
      custom.envvar: '${CUSTOM_LABEL}'
      custom.secret: '${CUSTOM_SECRET}'
  redis:
    image: 'redis:alpine'
```

## Rate limiting

Exoframe allows you to enable basic IP-based rate-limiting integrated into Traefik.  
To do that, simply specify the following fields in the project config file:

```js
{
  // adding this object will enable IP-based rate-limiting
  "rate-limit": {
    // average request rate over given time period
    // defaults to 1 if not specified
    "average": 5,
    // maximal burst request rate over given time period
    // defaults to 5 if not specified
    "burst": 10
  }
}
```

This will define how many requests (`average`) over given time (`period`) can be performed from one IP address.
For the example above - an average of 5 requests every second is allowed with busts of up to 10 requests.

For more information, see [Traefik rate-limiting docs](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/ratelimit/).

## Secrets

Exoframe allows you to create server-side secret values that can be used during service deployments.
To use secrets you first need to create one. This can be done by running:

```
$ exoframe secret new
```

Once you specify the name and value, Exoframe server will create new secret _for your current user_.
After creation the secret can be used in `exoframe.json` config file by using secret name and prefixing it with `@`, like so (in this example the secret was name `my-secret`):

```json
"env": {
  "SECRET_KEY": "@my-secret"
},
```

Current caveats:

- Currently secrets only work for environment variables
- Currently secrets work only for normal deployments (any template or recipe that uses `startFromParams` won't have secrets expanded)

## Accessing Exoframe data from within the deployed application

Exoframe provides a set of environment variables that are set on each deployment to allow getting project info and settings.  
Currently those are:

```bash
# owner of current deployment
EXOFRAME_USER=admin
# project of current deployment
EXOFRAME_PROJECT=projectName
# full deployment ID
EXOFRAME_DEPLOYMENT=exo-admin-deployName-ID
# host used to expose current deployment (if any)
EXOFRAME_HOST=exo-admin-deployName-ID.baseDomain
```

## Plugins

Exoframe-Server supports extension of core features using plugins.  
Plugins are installed and loaded automatically once corresponding config is added to [server configuration](./server.md).  
Refer to specific plugins docs to see how to configure them.
