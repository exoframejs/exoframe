# Complex recipes

Exoframe also provides support for third-party complex deployment recipes.
They allow to quickly and easily deploy complex projects.

For example, you can deploy Wordpress with PHPMyAdmin by simply executing `exoframe setup` and entering [exoframe-recipe-wordpress](https://github.com/exoframejs/exoframe-recipe-wordpress) as desired recipe.

You can find the list of available recipes [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=exoframe-recipe).
