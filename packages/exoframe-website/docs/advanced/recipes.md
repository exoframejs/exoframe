# Complex Recipes

Exoframe also supports third-party complex deployment recipes, providing a quick and easy way to deploy intricate projects.

For instance, deploying Ghost is as simple as executing `exoframe setup` and entering [exoframe-recipe-ghost](https://github.com/exoframejs/exoframe/tree/main/packages/exoframe-recipe-ghost) as the desired recipe.

Check the list of available recipes [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=exoframe-recipe).
