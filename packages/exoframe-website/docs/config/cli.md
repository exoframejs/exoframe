# Exoframe CLI Configuration

Exoframe stores its configuration in `~/.config/exoframe/cli.config.yml`. Currently, it contains a list of endpoint URLs with associated usernames and authentication tokens:

```yaml
endpoint: 'http://localhost:8080' # Your endpoint URL, defaults to localhost
```

You typically wouldn't need to manually edit it.
