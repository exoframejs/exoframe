# Exoframe CLI Configuration

Exoframe stores its config in `~/.config/exoframe/cli.config.yml`.
Currently it contains list of endpoint URLs with associated usernames and authentication tokens:

```yaml
endpoint: 'http://localhost:8080' # your endpoint URL, defaults to localhost
```

Normally you wouldn't need to edit it manually.
